## R_Tools Repository ##

This repository is nothing special, its just my personal space to put scripts, tools, and utilities that I need for my personal use.  I will leave a description of each tool here for your use.


**RProj_setup_tool/** - Professional R project setup tool that creates a standardized directory structure, .Rproj file, .gitignore, README, and optionally initializes renv for reproducible environments. Includes interactive prompts for project customization. Auto-loads in R sessions via .Rprofile.

  - Usage: `newproject("Your Project Name")`
  - Full documentation: See `RProj_setup_tool/RProj_setup_readme.txt`
  - Creates: data/, scripts/, output/, documentation/, archive/, and tmp/ directories
