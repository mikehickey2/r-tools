r_coding_standards

These standards help keep r code much more readable to everyone

1. Use a text editor or equivalent (no formatting)
2. Indent your code - different blocks of code should be spaced over to the right to understand the control flow
	1. Considerations --  How many indent spaces?
	2.  4 looks great // some people use 8
	3.  too small makes code look mashed
3. Limit the width of your code - limit to about 80 columns - enhances readability
4. Limit the length of individual functions
	1. Functions should do one thing
	2. Keep functions to about 1 page of code in a text editor
